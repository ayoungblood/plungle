# plungle

`plungle` is a command-line tool for radio codeplug conversion. It is designed to take a CSV or similar export from one CPS and convert it to a device-agnostic format, which can then be converted back to a CSV or similar format for import by another CPS, thus allowing you to translate a codeplug for one radio to another. It relies on the CPS to import/export and thus does not reverse-engineer the actual codeplug format. This means the process has a lot of steps, but also it probably won't brick your radio(s). However, you still need the CPS for _both_ radios.

Please also see [qdmr](https://dm3mat.darc.de/qdmr/), a tool by DM3MAT that reverse-engineers the codeplug formats of various radios and also provides a full UI and programming functionality. This may be easier to use if your radio is supported.
